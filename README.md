# python-socket-chat

This project was initially started as a challenge for myself to see have quickly I could get a functioning communication between client and server using non-blocking sockets and threads. Most of the early commits will be large in nature without branches as such.

themes.py is intended to help make the overal tkinter style more consistent and modular
